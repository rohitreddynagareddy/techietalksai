# Step 4 - MongoDB CRUD with Express + React\n\nThis step demonstrates connecting an Express backend to MongoDB (using mongoose) to store and retrieve notes. The React frontend provides a form to add notes and lists all notes from the database.\n\nYou must have MongoDB running. The included docker-compose.yml spins up a mongo service at mongodb://mongo:27017/notesdb.\n\nTo run locally:\n\n1. Start MongoDB (docker run or docker-compose up mongo)\n2. Start backend with: npx ts-node src/backend/server.ts\n3. Start frontend with: npm run dev\n4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view app\n
