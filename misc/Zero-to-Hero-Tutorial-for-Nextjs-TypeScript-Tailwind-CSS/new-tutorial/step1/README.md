# Step 1 - Basic Next.js + API

This step demonstrates a basic Next.js project with TypeScript, including a simple API route and a page using Tailwind CSS via CDN.

- Next.js page at / (pages/index.tsx)
- API route at /api/hello (pages/api/hello.ts)
- Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN in the page head

To run locally:

1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Run development server: npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000 to see the page
4. Open http://localhost:3000/api/hello to see the API response JSON

This step is the foundation for later steps that will add more features.
