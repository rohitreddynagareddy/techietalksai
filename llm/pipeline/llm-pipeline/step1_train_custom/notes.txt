## 🎙️ **Step 1: Train a Custom LLM – Tutorial Narration Script**

---

👋 "Hi everyone! In this tutorial, we’re going to walk through the code that trains a tiny custom Language Model using a simplified GPT-2 architecture. We'll break it down into 5 simple steps and I’ll explain what each part is doing."

---

### 🟦 **Step 1: Load the Dataset**

📖  
"We start by reading a small text file named `tiny_corpus.txt` from the `data` folder. This file contains a few sentences we want our model to learn from. We print a short sample from it just to visually confirm what’s inside."

🧠  
"This raw text is what we'll convert into tokens next."

---

### 🟩 **Step 2: Tokenize the Text**

🔤  
"Tokenization is the process of converting raw text into numbers that the model can understand. We use the GPT-2 tokenizer for this."

🧾  
"We set the padding token to match GPT-2’s end-of-sequence token, since GPT-2 doesn't have a pad token by default."

🧩  
"After tokenization, we get an `input_ids` tensor — basically a long list of numbers representing the words in the corpus."

📬  
"We print both the token IDs and their decoded text to confirm everything looks correct."

---

### 🟥 **Step 3: Define a Small GPT-2 Model**

🧱  
"Now we define the model. GPT-2 is a transformer-based language model, but we don’t need the full heavyweight version."

⚙️  
"So, we configure a **mini version** with:
- 2 layers,
- 2 attention heads,
- and 128-dimensional embeddings."

🔌  
"This keeps training lightweight and fast."

🖥️  
"Then we send the model to Apple Silicon’s MPS accelerator if it’s available — or to CPU otherwise."

---

### 🟨 **Step 4: Train the Model**

🏋️  
"Now it’s time to train! We use the AdamW optimizer and a small learning rate."

🔁  
"For each of 5 epochs, we:
- Clear old gradients,
- Run the model on our input tokens,
- Calculate the loss (how wrong the model is),
- Backpropagate the error,
- And update the weights."

📉  
"We print the loss after each epoch, so we can see how the model is improving."

---

### 🟪 **Step 5: Save the Model**

💾  
"Once training is complete, we save both the model and the tokenizer to a folder called `output_model`."

📦  
"This folder contains:
- `pytorch_model.bin`: the actual model weights,
- `config.json`: the model architecture settings,
- `tokenizer.json` and vocab files."

🔍  
"We also open the `config.json` file and display a preview of its contents."

---

### ✅ **Wrap-Up**

🎯  
"And that’s it! We've successfully trained and saved a small custom language model using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch. All of this happens in less than a minute and is super lightweight."

📢  
"In the next step, we’ll see how to **generate text using this model**!"
