Here's a heartfelt poem about dogs:

---

In the sun, they bound and play,  
With wagging tails, they light the day.  
So loyal, true, and full of cheer,  
A dog’s love is forever near.  

Their eyes like pools of endless trust,  
In every bark, we hear a must.  
Through fields they romp, through mud they dive,  
In every heartbeat, they feel alive.  

When the world feels heavy, dark, and cold,  
A furry friend is worth more than gold.  
With every nuzzle, every playful chase,  
They bring pure joy to every space.  

So here's to dogs, both big and small,  
In every home, they bless us all.  
With loyalty that never shakes,  
In their sweet presence, love awakes.  

--- 

Enjoy the beauty and companionship that dogs bring!
