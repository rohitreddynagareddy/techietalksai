Gluai Buat Chi (Bananas in Coconut Milk) Recipe

This traditional Thai dessert is both simple and delicious. Here's how to make it:

Ingredients (Serves 2)
5 almost-ripe Nam Wa bananas
1/4 cup coconut cream
1 1/2 cups coconut milk
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 tablespoon salt
Preparation Time
Total: 30 minutes
Preparation: 10 minutes
Cooking: 20 minutes
Directions
Prepare the Bananas:

Peel the bananas and slice them vertically into halves, then horizontally into smaller pieces.
Cook the Bananas:

Pour the coconut milk into a pot and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and add the bananas.
Cook until the bananas are tender (be careful not to overcook).
Add Flavors:

Turn off the heat and stir in the sugar and salt until dissolved.
Finish Up:

Add the coconut cream and allow it to cool to room temperature before serving.
Tips
You can substitute Nam Wa bananas with options like sweet potato, pumpkin, or tapioca; just ensure they are boiled until cooked but not mashed.
If using unripe bananas, boil them in water for 3-5 minutes first to reduce stickiness.
Enjoy your delightful Gluai Buat Chi!
