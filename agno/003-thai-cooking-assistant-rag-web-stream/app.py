"""üß† Recipe Expert with Knowledge - Your AI Thai Cooking Assistant!

This example shows how to create an AI cooking assistant that combines knowledge from a
curated recipe database with web searching capabilities. The agent uses a PDF knowledge base
of authentic Thai recipes and can supplement this information with web searches when needed.

Example prompts to try:
- "How do I make authentic Pad Thai?"
- "What's the difference between red and green curry?"
- "Can you explain what galangal is and possible substitutes?"
- "Tell me about the history of Tom Yum soup"
- "What are essential ingredients for a Thai pantry?"
- "How do I make Thai basil chicken (Pad Kra Pao)?"
